To use the objects' coordinates to fill the corresponding positions on the board, you can modify the code as follows:



csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create a 5x5 board as a 2D array
        MyObject[,] board = new MyObject[5, 5];

        // Create and add objects to the board
        MyObject obj1 = new MyObject(2, 4);
        MyObject obj2 = new MyObject(3, 5);

        // Add objects to the board using their coordinates
        board[obj1.X, obj1.Y] = obj1;
        board[obj2.X, obj2.Y] = obj2;

        // Display the board
        for (int row = 0; row < 5; row++)
        {
            for (int col = 0; col < 5; col++)
            {
                MyObject obj = board[row, col];
                if (obj != null)
                {
                    Console.Write(obj.ToString());
                }
                else
                {
                    Console.Write("Empty");
                }

                Console.Write("\t");
            }
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
}
In this updated code:

We create two MyObject instances, obj1 and obj2, with coordinates [2, 4] and [3, 5], respectively.

We use the coordinates of these objects to access and set the corresponding positions on the board 2D array. This ensures that the objects are placed correctly on the board based on their coordinates.

The rest of the code for displaying the board remains the same as in the previous example.

Now, the objects are added to the board at their respective coordinates, allowing you to use their coordinates to fill the necessary positions on the board accurately. This helps you practice working with objects and their coordinates in C#.
